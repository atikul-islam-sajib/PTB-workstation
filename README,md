# Text Classification with GloVe and Word2Vec Embeddings

This repository contains Python code for performing text classification using machine learning models such as Random Forest, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and XGBoost. The code incorporates pre-trained word embeddings from GloVe and Word2Vec to improve classification performance.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the code, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Gensim
- XGBoost (optional, if you intend to use XGBoost)

You can install these packages using `pip`:

```shell
pip install pandas scikit-learn gensim xgboost
