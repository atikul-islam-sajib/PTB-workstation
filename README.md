Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is a common natural language processing (NLP) task. In this task, we will build a machine learning model to classify text data into different sentiment categories: positive, negative, or neutral. The goal is to determine the sentiment expressed in a given text, such as a product review or a social media post.
